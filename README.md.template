# markdown-add-files
github action to add in files as examples to markdown files 

this action finds .md.template files and replaces `+++file: ./app.tsx` with the code from that file. it then takes that .md.template file and creates a file with just .md

## example 
this is a very simple action that simple builds the template files and then pushes the built markdown to the repo
+++file: ./example/generate-markdown.yml
